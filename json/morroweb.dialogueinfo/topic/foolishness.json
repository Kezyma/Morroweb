I foolishly followed them, and took my wife to Vvardenfell for what was supposed to be a \"great adventure\".  I paid for my foolishness, paid in full.  Unfortunately, my wife was made to pay as well.  She caught the Blight shortly after arriving, and her frail constitution couldn't handle it.  I lost her to the damned disease, and it ruined me.  No one could replace her.  None of the women I've ever know could ever replace her.",
