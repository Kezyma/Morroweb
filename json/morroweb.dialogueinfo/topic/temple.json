    "Text": "The Tribunal Temple is the native religion. They worship three God-Kings, Almalexia, Sotha Sil, and Vivec, who are known together as the Tribunal. We usually just call it 'The Temple.' They're narrow-minded and superstitious, but I find a lot to admire -- particularly their concern for the poor. They accept outlanders as members, but few outlanders join except for the services. Talk to Feldrelo Sadri at the Balmora Temple if you're thinking about joining.",
