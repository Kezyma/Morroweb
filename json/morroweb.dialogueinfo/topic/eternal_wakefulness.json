The truth is, I haven't slept at all in six months.  %PCName, if you happen to run into the seer, maybe you could convince him to lift the curse?  His name is Geilir the Mumbling, and he lives by himself in a dwelling here on Solstheim.  Do this for me, and I will share with you the most valuable secret I learned when I was a ship captain.",

So I made sure Thormoor would never fall asleep again.  Fitting punishment, don't you think?  Sorry, but there's nothing you could do to make me reverse my curse.  Nothing, that....
