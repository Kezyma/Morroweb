    "Text": "Roaming the wilds of Solsteim are seldom seen, elusive species of wolf and bear.  They're called snow wolves and snow bears, because of their white fur.  It is said that the pelts of these animals have innate magical qualities that help guard against Solstheim's brutal frost and snow.  Just think of the armor I could create with such materials!  If you were to provide me with the pelts and enough gold, I would gladly make you a set of custom snow wolf armor or snow bear armor.",
