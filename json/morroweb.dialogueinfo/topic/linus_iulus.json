I believe she knew he was not equal to the task, though he begged for the quest, and I think his death is a burden on her conscience. I doubt that any of his physical remains will survive years of exposure to the elements. But you might find his Maran Amulet and Stendarran Belt. It would be a comfort to pass them on to other lay servants, to honor the memory of Linus Iulus.",
