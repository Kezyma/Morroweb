    "Text": "Kagrenac recorded every step in his manufacture and testing of enchanted items. His journals will record any modifications or enhancements made to his original designs. I don't know where the journals might be. I am fairly sure they haven't been discovered, or Divayth Fyr would have heard, and would have told me.
