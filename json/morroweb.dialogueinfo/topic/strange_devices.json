At the time, I stumbled and fell, only to hear her laughing maniacally. She was upset that they weren't strong enough! When I'd recovered a bit, I tried asking what she was up to, and she exploded at me. Accused me of being a spy, of trying to steal from her. She ran me out of the manor, and I haven't spoken to her since, which suits me just fine.",
