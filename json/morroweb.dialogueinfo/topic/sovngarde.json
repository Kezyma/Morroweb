    "Text": "Sovngarde is the name of the fortress erected by the god Shor as a gift to the valiant. It is said that if a Nord can locate the hidden entrance to Sovngarde, they can dwell in its mead-filled halls forever! That's the quest we were on, you see. It's why Grimkell betrayed us, why he tried to turn us all into stone. He was attempting to create his own magical portal to Sovngarde. Now Grimkell is dead, as are my friends. And I...I have failed in our quest!",
