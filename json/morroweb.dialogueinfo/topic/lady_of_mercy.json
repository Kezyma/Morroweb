    "Text": "Almalexia's the Mother of us all, healer and protector. Always has been. I suppose She doesn't seem that way now. It's the war with Dagoth Ur. It's hard for all of us. She's had to change -- to toughen Herself and Her followers. It's true that sometimes dissenters disappear when they question Her doctrines. The Hands of Almalexia are more like inquisitors than knights of loving mercy. And Mournhold doesn't feel much like the City of Love any more. But hard times demand hard gods.",
