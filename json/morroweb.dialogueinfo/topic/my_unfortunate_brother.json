I understand your position, %PCName -- you have to defend yourself. But I also must ask you to understand mine -- I have to avenge my brother. Thus, a duel is called for, and there is no time like the present. Prepare yourself, %PCName. Thy doom is imminent, and I have other matters to attend to.",
