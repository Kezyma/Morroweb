    "Text": "For you to fulfill the prophecy and unite the four tribes, you must be named as the Nerevarine by each of the four Vvardenfell tribes. When you tell your story to the ashkhan of each tribe, and show them your proofs, he should acknowledge you as Nerevarine on behalf of his tribe. But it may not be so simple. An ashkhan may take the opportunity to extract a favor or service from you. Or the Erabenimsun may not be so ready to accept an outlander as Nerevarine.",
