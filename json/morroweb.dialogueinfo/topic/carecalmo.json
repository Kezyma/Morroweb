    "Text": "Carecalmo is a very old High Elf wizard. As a young mage he served Uriel V, though he did not follow him to Akavir. He was accounted among the wise and powerful until he was implicated in Jagar Tharn's plot to place an impostor on the Imperial throne. Since then he and his bodyguard, a masterful knight named Meryaran, have been fugitives. Carecalmo is a servant of Mehrunes Dagon, a grim agent of death and destruction, and the Imperial cult has long sought to destroy him.",
