    "Text": "The hand-to-hand discipline is the martial art of unarmed combat. Inspired by the mystical martial arts disciplines of the Khajiit, this unarmed combat style has been adopted in the West by agents and thieves whose scruples forbid them to seriously injure or kill their opponents. Unlike weapon attacks, which only injure and kill, defeating an opponent in hand-to-hand combat renders him unconsciousness and helpless. However, once a target is unconscious, hand-to-hand attacks cause wounds and death.",
