    "Text": "The long reach and high efficiency of this two-handed long-shafted axe-like weapon makes it well-suited for combat with encumbered, heavily armored opponents. Using this weapon in massed formations requires a high degree of skill and training, and it's bulk makes it difficult to use in close quarters, so the weapon is, with significant exceptions, neither common nor popular for use by mercenaries or adventurers.",
