A path leads through a break in the mountains from the Pelagiad-Balmora road, but the turnoff isn't marked. It may be easiest to go all the way to Balmora, then head south from the gate near the strider port, climb over the ridge, keeping the river on your left. Watch for the fire of the mining camp at the entrance.",
