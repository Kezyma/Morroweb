    "Text": "I came to Solstheim with four of my brothers-in-arms.  We were on a quest, you see.  We were getting close...we could feel it.  But then, one of our fellowship -- a powerful sorceror named Grimkell -- betrayed the rest of us.  He laid an ambush, and assailed us with powerful magicka.  I managed to slay Grimkell, but not before my three other companions were turned to stone. You may have seen them, for they are the three standing stones of Brodir Grove, not far from here.",
