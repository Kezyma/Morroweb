Great Houses culture is partly defined by its roots in ancient Dunmer tribal clans, and partly by later Imperial  influences from other Western cultures. The Great Houses culture is only one of the native Dunmer cultures of Morrowind. The other native culture, the Ashlander culture, is a nomadic barbarian culture largely untouched by Imperial influences.",
