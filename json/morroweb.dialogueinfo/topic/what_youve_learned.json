And considering the recent increase in Blight storms and other activity near Red Mountain, I wonder if something has gone wrong in the Temple's ancient war with Dagoth Ur... something the Temple is eager to hide.",

Both may know things we need to know in order to have you satisfy the conditions of the Nerevarine prophecies. And though I'm still skeptical about signs and prophecies, the political grievances between the Ashlanders and the Tribunal, and the conflicts within the Temple itself, I take very seriously.",
