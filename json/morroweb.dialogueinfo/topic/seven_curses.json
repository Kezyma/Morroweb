    "Text": "It is another Ashlander prophecy of the Nerevarine. It is called \"The Seven Curses of the Sharmat.\" But I do not know it, and I know no one who does. It may be lost. Such things happen. A wise woman dies, or forgets, or a clan is wiped out. Perhaps someone knows, but is keeping it secret. Perhaps it is in one of those many books of your settled peoples. I have heard that the Dissident priests of the Temple may have such books.",
