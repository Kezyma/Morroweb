Personally, I favor long blades of all kinds -- they use long blades of many different styles and craftsmanships here in Morrowind -- and I wear medium armor, for a decent balance of protection and mobility. But I train with various weapon types and armor types. And like any good warrior, I'm my own armorer -- don't want to fight with worn weapons in worn armor.",
