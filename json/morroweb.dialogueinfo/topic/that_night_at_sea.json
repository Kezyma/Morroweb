    "Text": "A few months ago I was ferrying some settlers from Skyrim to Solstheim.  I was tired...so tired.  I fell asleep at the rudder.  The ship drifted into a gale, and by the time I woke, it was too late.  I couldn't regain control, and the ship capsized.  There were only two survivors -- me, and an old man whose entire family was lost in the wreck.  I told the man of my terrible failure, and he used his power as a seer and wizard to punish me.  You see, %PCName, I have been cursed with eternal wakefulness.",
