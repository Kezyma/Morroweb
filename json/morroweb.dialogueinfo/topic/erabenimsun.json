Ashkhan Ulath-Pal is ruthless and arrogant, and he surrounds himself with gulakhans like himself. Blood will be spilled; let it not be yours. There is one gulakhan of their tribe, Han-Ammu, who might be shaped as a new ashkhan. He is a weak reed, but his Wise Woman, Manirai, is strong and resourceful. Seek her counsel.",
