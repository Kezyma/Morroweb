First you have to join the Imperial cult, then go to the Imperial Chapels in Ebonheart to get work. See Synnolian Tunifus to become a lay healer. See Iulus Truptor to become an almoner -- a fund raiser. See Kaye to become a shrine sergeant -- they do the more dangerous jobs.",

You would be forced to devote yourself full time to the Imperial Cult, which doesn't suit adventurous people like yourself. But we do need lay servants -- earnest laymen dedicated to serving the Nine -- for certain unglamorous but spiritually rewarding tasks. At present we need almoners to serve Zenithar, lay healers to serve Mara, and shrine sergeants to serve Stendarr.",
