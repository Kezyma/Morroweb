    "Text": "Almalexia, Sotha Sil, and I gained our divine powers from the Heart of Lorkhan. And now we no longer have access to the Heart, so we must lose our divinity. I have always worn my divinity lightly -- fundamentally, I am not at all a serious person -- and I will not miss it. I have tried to do what was necessary. I am afraid I have done some harm. I assure you -- I will be quite content to be a mere mortal again, dedicated to my own amusements.",
