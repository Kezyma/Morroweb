This is not a pawn shop; you may not come back and reclaim artifacts when you feel like it. I can tell you that the Museum is prepared to offer fifty percent of the value of any artifact, up to 30000 gold; I believe you'll find this is a more profitable offer than any other that will be made to you.",

Should you want to sell something you feel the Museum will be interested in, bring the item here and we can assess its value.
