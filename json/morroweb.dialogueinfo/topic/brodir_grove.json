    "Text": "Brodir Grove is where Grimkell ambushed us.  My friends were turned to stone on that very spot, and there they remain, a monument of betrayal.  I too was caught in the spell, but thought I had been spared its effects.  I was wrong.  Instead of killing me, like it did my friends, Grimkell's magicka turned me into living stone.  You see, these events did take place -- five hundred years ago.  I have remained here ever since.  And here I will stay, until I finally find the entrance to Sovngarde.",
