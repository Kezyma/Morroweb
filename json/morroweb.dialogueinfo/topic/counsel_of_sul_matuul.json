    "Text": "Second, I tell you, seek the counsel of Wise Woman Nibani Maesa, for you are an Outlander, and ignorant of the ways of our people. Nibani Maesa can tell you of the other tribes, of their ways, and of their ashkhans. If you do not know these things, you will make many mistakes, and waste precious time. That is my counsel. Now, if you wish to be named Urshilaku Nerevarine, we may speak of these things.",

    "Text": "Good. First, I would give you warning. When you are called 'Nerevarine,' the word must spread, and many must hear. Your enemies will hear, and come seeking your blood. And such friends as you may have among the Great Houses, those who heed the words of the Temple, they may forget their love for you. If you have business with the People of the Houses and Temple, you may wish to conduct that business first, before you are named 'Nerevarine.'",
