I just heard some reports of Kagouti attacking traders along that route as well, so be careful. If you see any Kagouti near there, kill them too. It's best to start in Gnisis and cross the river south of the silt strider. When you reach a rough trail, follow it east and south. When the trail branches south and east, take the east fork.",
