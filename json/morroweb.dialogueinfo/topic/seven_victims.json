    "Text": "The two Ordinators were found dead near the victim at Hlaalu Compound, and we think they coincidentally interrupted the killer at work. Both had their throats slit with a dagger. That neither Ordinator had drawn a weapon is extremely unsettling. It suggests either extraordinary stealth, or a very powerful sorcerer. That's all we know about the victims. And there's not much information from witnesses, either.",

Two were found in Foreign Quarters corridors, one on Foreign Quarter Canalside, one in a Hlaalu Compound corridor, and one in the water near the Arena. All were armed. Only one, a mage, appears to have put up a fight. All had their throats slit with a dagger. Until the two Ordinators were killed, we thought it might be an anti-Imperial fanatic.
