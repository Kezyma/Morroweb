    "Text": "I'm told that a shirt and vest together is what they call here a 'common shirt.' There are many styles of common shirt, but we must have a red shirt with a black vest to symbolize the drake's fire that warms us in long, cold winter nights. Since the red shirt and black vest are a Western style, Dunmer clothiers may not have them. You may have better luck in Vivec's Foreign Quarter, or Balmora, Caldera, or Pelagiad.",
