    "Text": "Ah, beautiful, glorious clutter. I can't get enough of it! You know what I'm talking about, traveler. Clutter is everywhere you look. Tamriel's residences are filled with enough worthless housewares to choke a wild kagouti. Tables full of plates and utensils, bottles upon bottles upon bottles, barrels and baskets filled with pillows -- these are my consuming passion. I'm a collector, you see, and I think my collection of Morrowind's clutter is virtually complete. Take a look around!",
