    "Text": "Tel Aruhn is the wizard's tower and village of the Telvanni Archmagister Gothren. Let me mark it on your map. Travel crosscountry to the southeast until you reach the water. Tel Aruhn is on an island in Zafirbel Bay, a long swim from shore. From the Dunmer Stronghold Indoranyon, go south. From Sadrith Mora, Tel Aruhn is due west. From Tel Fyr, Tel Aruhn is north. Here's another landmark. Thiralas Ancestral Tomb is on the mainland, near the bay. Tel Aruhn is the second island southeast from this tomb.",
