The entrance is located on the shores of Lake Fjalding, just to the west of here.  I'm sure you will find the creature there, licking his wounds.  If you can manage to slay the Udyrfrykte, make sure you claim some part of the beast as a trophy. Bring that trophy back to me, and I will name you chieftain of Thirsk, for that is our way.  Go now, and good hunting.",
