    "Text": "A bewildering variety of one-hand axe styles are found in Morrowind. The spiked chitin war axe favored by Ashlander and Great House Dunmer is in some ways more like a mace than an axe. The steel war axe is double-bladed; the iron war axe is single-bladed; the glass, ebony, and daedric war axes are single-bladed with balancing spikes.",
