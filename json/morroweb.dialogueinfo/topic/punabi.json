Go past the Dwemer ruin and follow the winding trail east until you reach a lake. You will see Marandus to your south. I will mark this stronghold on your map. Head north from Marandus on the path between the hills. Punabi will be on your right and Sulipund is further up the path on the left. Just follow the signs to Molag Mar.",
