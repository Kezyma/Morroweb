I've also contributed a scroll that may help insure the arrow finds it's mark, and that you are not seen. I'd suggest remaining in the Mining Tower for safety. Once you're prepared, ready your bow to signal that Baslod should make his attack. He'll draw the guards away, and then you strike. With Falco assassinated, the colony should collapse in a very short time.",
