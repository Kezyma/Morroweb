    "Text": "Chitin weapons of native Dunmer manufacture are created from the sturdy but light exoskeletons of local creatures. Layers of chitin are typically laminated using vegetable, shalk, and bug resin glues to form strong but flexible weapons. The serrated edges of the original materials are exploited to create especially wicked daggers and slashing weapons.",
