Though Ald'ruhn is nearly due north as the racer flies, the road swings far to the west to avoid the ash wastes, curving around at last to the east, even southeast, before approaching Ald'ruhn. It is a long trip through desolate lands, and easy to get lost if you leave the road. Alternatively, pay for passage on a silt strider.",
