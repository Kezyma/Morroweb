I don't understand the mumbo-jumbo of dream interpretation, but she tells me that an old name for Mount Kand is Mountain of Fear. As she reads her dream, she believes the staff will be found either east or west of the mountain, in the shadow of the rising or setting sun. The Detect Enchantment ring should help you find the staff.",
