    "Text": "You're new at Frostmoth so I guess you haven't heard. Over the past couple of months several people across Solstheim have been poisoned...with moon sugar. Someone has been slipping it into their food and wine. They experience temporary euphoria, and then complete exhaustion. I've been charged with finding the culprit and bringing him to justice. Recently our Cult priest Jeleen was poisoned, so it is now officially an Imperial matter.",

I am a law-biding man, %PCName, and have never experienced anything so...free, in all my life!  The laughing, the dancing...it was horrible!  And then, as I drifted off, I saw him.
