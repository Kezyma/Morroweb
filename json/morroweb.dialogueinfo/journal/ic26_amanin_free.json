She had been snatched from the Gnisis-Ald'ruhn road by winged twilights, who bore her deep within Berandas and stranded her on a pillar of rock. She had prayed to the Nine for aid, and thought I was the answer to her prayers. She asked me for a Divine Intervention scroll, so she could escape, but I didn't have any. She suggested I should go get one and bring it back so she could be rescued.",
