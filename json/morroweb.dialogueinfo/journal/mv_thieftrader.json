Apparently, though, gro-Skandar has yet to show up, agitating Lucan greatly. It seems Lucan would like me to help him by delivering a shipment of weapons for him to Yak gro-Skandar at the Rat in the Pot in Ald'ruhn. He has offered to pay me 100 septims for my time, and he asks me to swear an oath to Zenithar to seal the bargain.",
