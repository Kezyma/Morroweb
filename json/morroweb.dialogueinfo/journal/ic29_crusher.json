    "Text": "The Oracle believes that I am fated to recover the ancient warhammer Skull-Crusher. I must discover a sealed Daedric ruin that may be accessed only through the Halls of the Dead. To help me solve the puzzle of this prophecy, the Oracle told me to consult a Dunmer scout and a Dunmer savant. Her vision suggests I must face restless spirits and powerful Daedra to recover the warhammer. If I find Skull-Crusher, I must return it to the Oracle so she may free it of its creators' curse.",

'Ruhn' translates as 'home' or 'hearth-hall'. 'Card' means 'undeparted kin-wardens'. Then to find access to Skull-Crusher in its sealed Daedric ruin, I must search for ancestral tombs near the ruin.
