    "Text": "Bacola Closcius gave me a bottle of Cyrodilic brandy for the fundraising dinner at Fort Moonmoth. He also hinted that Banor Seran at the Council Club just took delivery of some Cyrodilic brandy, and that he's probably got it stored in a closet in the hall  just right of the bar. He says the Council Club is just a front for Camonna Tong gangsters, suggesting it wouldn't REALLY be a crime to steal the brandy from them.",
